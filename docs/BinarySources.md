# Binary sources

Binary sources just give the superposition of two single-source microlensing light curves. In VBBinaryLensing we have the `BinSourceLightCurve` function, illustrated in the following example:

```
VBBinaryLensing VBBL; // Declare instance to VBBinaryLensing

double pr[6]; // Array of parameters
double tE, FR, u01, u02, t01, t02, t;

u01 = 0.01; // Impact parameter for source 1
u02 = 0.03; // Impact parameter for source 2
t01 = 7550.4; // Time of closest approach to source 1
t02 = 7551.8; // Time of closest approach to source 2
tE = 37.3; // Einstein time
FR = 0.1; // Flux ratio of the second source to the first

// Let us put all parameters in our array
pr[0] = log(tE);
pr[1] = log(FR);
pr[2] = u01;
pr[3] = u02;
pr[4] = t01;
pr[5] = t02;

t = 7551.6; // Time at which we want to calculate the magnification

Mag = VBBL.BinSourceLightCurve(pr, t); // Calculates the Binary Source magnification at time t with parameters in pr
printf("Binary Source Light Curve at time t: %lf", Mag); // Output should be 29.97...
```

The output of BinSourceLightCurve is a magnification compared to the baseline flux. Therefore, it is the sum of two Paczynsky light curves weighted by 1/(1+FR) and FR/(1+FR) respectively.

Parallax is included in the `BinSourceLightCurveParallax` function, which accepts two more parameters for the parallax components, as illustrated in the [Parallax](Parallax.md) section.

## Extended binary sources

If the finite size of the sources is relevant, one can use `BinSourceLightCurve` function

```
rho = 0.01; // Size of source 1
pr[6] = log(rho); 
Mag = VBBL.BinSourceExtLightCurve(pr, t); // Calculates the magnification for extended binary sources
```

Only one source size is specified as an independent parameter, while the source size of the second source is obtained through mass-radius-luminosity relations. This ensures that the user has full control on the physical consistency of the model.

## Mass-radius-luminosity relations for binary sources

The mass-luminosity relation in VBBinaryLensing is a power law of the form $L \sim M^q$ where the exponent $q$ is given by the variable `VBBL.mass_luminosity_exponent`, whose default value is $4.0$.

The mass-radius relation is a power law of the form $\rho \sim M^p$ where the exponent $p$ is given by the variable `VBBL.mass_radius_exponent`, whose default value is $0.9$.

Therefore, in the function `BinSourceExtLightCurve`, if the flux ratio is `FR` and the radius of the first source is `rho`, the radius of the second source is calculated as `rho * FR^{p/q}`.

The user can customize the two exponents by changing `VBBL.mass_luminosity_exponent` and `VBBL.mass_radius_exponent` as appropriate for the sources in the specific microlensing event and for the observation band.

## Xallarap

Binary sources can also orbit around a common center of mass. VBBinaryLensing offers xallarap with circular orbital motion, described by 6 parameters:

$(\xi_\parallel, \xi_\perp)$, projections of the node lines parallel and perpendicular to the source velocity at time $t_0$. Note that the orbital radius in Einstein angle units is $\sqrt{\xi_\parallel^2 + \xi_\perp^2}$;

$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$, orbital angular velocity;

$i$, inclination of the orbit;

$\phi_0$, phase at time $t_0$ from the line of nodes;

$q_s$, mass ratio of the two source components.

Here is an example with the function `BinSourceSingleLensXallarap`. You may note that the parametrization of the sources is very different with respect to the previous functions.

```
VBBinaryLensing VBBL; // Declare instance to VBBinaryLensing
VBBL.LoadESPLTable("ESPL.tbl");

double pr[10]; // Array of parameters
double u0, t0, tE, rho, xi1, xi2, om, inc, phi0, qs, t, Mag;

u0 = 0.01; // Impact parameter for the first source
t0 = 7550.4; // Time of closest approach for the first source
tE = 37.3; // Einstein time
rho = 0.004; // Radius of the first star
xi1 = 0.011; // Xallarap component 1
xi2 = 0.02; // Xallarap component 2
om = 0.04; // Orbital velocity
inc = 0.8; // Inclination
phi0 = 1.4; // Phase from the line of nodes
qs = 0.1; // Mass ratio of the two stars

// Let us put all parameters in our array
pr[0] = u0;
pr[1] = t0;
pr[2] = log(tE);
pr[3] = log(rho);
pr[4] = xi1;
pr[5] = xi2;
pr[6] = om;
pr[7] = inc;
pr[8] = phi0;
pr[9] = log(qs);

t = 7551.6; // Time at which we want to calculate the magnification

Mag = VBBL.BinSourceSingleLensXallarap(pr, t); // Calculates the Binary Source magnification at time t with parameters in pr
printf("Binary Source Light Curve at time t: %lf", Mag); // Output should be 29.76...
```

In this function we are assuming that all properties of the sources can be deduced by their mass ratio through the mass-radius-luminosity relations specified above and customizable by the user. Therefore, the flux ratio will be `FR = qs^q`, where `q` is given by `VBBL.mass_luminosity_exponent` and the radius of the second source will be `rho * qs^p`, where `p` is given by `VBBL.mass_radius_exponent`.

Xallarap is also available for binary lenses through the `BinSourceBinaryLensXallarap` function. In this case, the parameters are 13 with the seven parameters for the [static binary lens](BinaryLenses.md) followed by the six parameters for the xallarap.
