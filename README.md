#NOTICE
This is a legacy package no longer maintained. Please use the new package [VBMicrolensing](https://github.com/valboz/VBMicrolensing), which contains all the functions of `VBBinaryLensing` with further optimizations and supports multiple lensing too!

# VBBinaryLensing

`VBBinaryLensing` is a tool for efficient computation in gravitational 
microlensing events using the advanced contour integration method, supporting single and binary lenses. 

In particular, VBBinaryLensing is designed for the following calculations:
- **Magnification** by single and binary lenses
- **Centroid** of the images generated by single and binary lenses
- **Critical curves and caustics** of binary lenses
- Complete **light curves** including several higher order effects: limb darkening of the source, binary source, parallax, xallarap, circular and elliptic orbital motion.

The code has been developed by Valerio Bozza, University of Salerno.
It is written as a C++ library and wrapped as a Python package, the user
can call the code from either C++ or Python.

The root finding algorithm has been adopted from Jan Skowron & Andy Gould
(http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~jskowron/cmplx_roots_sg/)
and translated to C++ by Tyler M. Heintz and Ava R. Hoag.
The new Python wrapper has been created by Fran BartoliÄ‡ in collaboration with Etienne Bachelet and Markus Hundertmark.

VBBinaryLensing is also adopted by several user-friendly modeling platforms for microlensing:
- [pyLIMA](https://github.com/ebachelet/pyLIMA)
- [MulensModel](https://github.com/rpoleski/MulensModel)
- [muLAn](https://github.com/muLAn-project/muLAn)

These platforms offer high-level frameworks for easy modeling of microlensing events. Consider using those codes if you do not want to develop your own modeling or simulation code. On the other hand, if you need direct access to basic functions to include in your own project, this is the right place for you.

A selection of recent reviews about microlensing and its applications can be found [here](/docs/reviews.md).

## Installation

### Python

The easiest way to install VBBinaryLensing is through `pip`
```
pip install VBBinaryLensing
```
If you want the latest development version from Github, clone this 
repository and run
```
python setup.py install
```

Currently, `VBBinaryLensing` works on Linux, Windows, MacOS and python >= 2.7. 
The python package requires `pybind11` which can be installed with
```
pip install pybind11
```
The package requires a C++ compiler supporting C++.

### C++

If you just want to use the C++ library, clone this repository, the 
library files `VBBinaryLensingLibrary.cpp` and
`VBBinaryLensing.h` are located in in `VBBinaryLensing/lib`. 
An example usage
of the C++ code is provided in `examples/cpp_examples` together with
a sample `Makefile` for compiling the library.

The package also contains the following files:
- `examples/cpp_examples/instructions.cpp` - Contains working examples and specific instructions for all functions.
- `VBBinaryLensing/data/ESPL.tbl`  - Pre-calculated table for Extended-source-point-lens
- `VBBinaryLensing/data/OB151212coords.txt` - Sample file with event coordinates
- `VBBinaryLensing/data/satellite1.txt` - Sample table for satellite position (Spitzer)
- `VBBinaryLensing/data/satellite2.txt` - Sample table for satellite position (Kepler)

## Example usage
To check the installation, try:
```python
>>>import VBBinaryLensing

# Initialize the VBBinaryLensing object which contains all functions 
>>>VBBL = VBBinaryLensing.VBBinaryLensing()

>>>s = 1.
>>>q = 0.02
>>>y1 = 0.5 
>>>y2 = 0.5 
>>>rho = 0.0033

# Calculate magnification for a single point in the source plane
>>>magnification = VBBL.BinaryMag2(s, q, y1, y2, rho)
>>>print(magnification)
>>>1.6310924403681109
```

Example Jupyter notebooks are included in `examples/python_examples`.

## Documentation
Full [documentation for the use of VBBinaryLensing in C++](/docs/readme.md) is available. This can be a good reference also for Python users. 

Furthermore, the vast majority of functions are documented with Python docstrings which can be accessed as, for example, `?VBBL.BinaryMag2()` in
a Jupyter notebook.

Note that the python wrapper does not support the user-defined limb-darkening law.
